# Gene analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains script(s) to analyse data generated by nanostring nCounter SPRINT, i.e. mRNA data. The analysis is slightly different than what is typically done for RNA-seq data due to substantially fewer genes (770) are present. Limma was used for this analysis. 

#### Input data
The data is pre-processed in nanostring's own software; nSolver. Here, normalisation and background thresholding is done. Background thresholding was done based on the geometric mean of the negative probes. The analysis is based on the covariate 'cavitation dose' and the factor 'bubble' in the data set. 

#### Output data
The script will plot volcano plots, venn diagrams, and gene enrichment plot for the different relevant groups.

#### Running the script
Running the script is easy. You would need to change the input files (gene data and meta data), and change design matrix according to the desired analysis.
